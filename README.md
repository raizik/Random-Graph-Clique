# Random-Graph-Clique
These simulations find the largest clique size in G(n,1/2) according to the following heuristics:
## Section A: 
Constructs a clique by iteratively picking an arbitrary vertex which is connected to all vertices chosen so far
## Section B:
Constructs a clique by iteratively picking a vertex of maximal degree
## hw2.py
Computation of the expected size of the clique when n = 1000 exactly with heuristic in section A
